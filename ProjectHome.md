## Looking for transitfeed, FeedValidator, and other Python tools? ##

These have **moved** to https://github.com/google/transitfeed

## Introduction ##

The GoogleTransitDataFeed Open Source Software project is an effort to offer tools for reading, writing, and converting to and from the [General\* Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) format, to help make public transit information projects more successful for agencies and other interested parties.

The project currently offers a tool for converting data in the TransXChange format to GTFS.

Note to developers: Source code management on this site is handled by [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org).
Literature tip: I recommend the [Red Bean book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/) by Ben Collins-Sussman, Brian W. Fitzpatrick & C. Michael Pilato.

`*` Formerly [Google Transit Data Feed](http://groups.google.com/group/gtfs-changes/browse_thread/thread/a1bffb3083af3b15)

## Sharing data ##
We are constantly adding links to public feeds [in GTFS](http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/PublicFeeds) as well as [non-GTFS and real-time feeds](http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/PublicFeedsNonGTFS).

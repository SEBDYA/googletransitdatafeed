= Introduction =

The feedvalidator is a command line tool that checks a Google Transit Feed for problems and generates a HTML report.  Running it on your transit data feed and fixing the issues that it finds can save you from display and routing problems down the road.

For a list of the errors and warnings that FeedValidator outputs, see the FeedValidatorErrorsAndWarnings page.

You may run the validator on an uncompressed directory of GTFS txt files. I recommend you validate your final google_transit.zip just before publishing it to catch any mistakes creating the zip. If you have an script that generates your GTFS file consider making validation a final step and aborting if it exits with an error.


= Windows standalone version =

We provide a Windows executable version for convenience; if you're running Windows, you should use this one.  To get it, download the latest `transitfeed-(version)-windows.zip` from the [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list project download page].

Once you have it downloaded and unzipped, there are a few ways to run it:

==== Easiest ====
Drag a GTFS zip file or directory onto `feedvalidator.exe`.  A window will pop up with the result of the validation test:

==== Intermediate ====
Double-click `feedvalidator.exe`.  A window will pop up and ask you to enter the location of your feed file or directory.  You can type it in, or just drag a GTFS file or directory onto the window and hit Enter.

==== Expert ====
Go to the Windows command prompt, and type: `feedvalidator <name of feed file or directory>`.  If you want to avoid the prompt at the end of the validation, use the `--noprompt` parameter.

= Python source code version =

Use this version if you're on Mac OS X or Linux.

Before you run the feed validator you must install Python. It is tested with versions 2.4 and 2.5 and should work with 2.6. You can download Python from http://www.python.org/download/

Fetch the transitfeed distribution from our source code repository (see Source tab above) or by downloading `transitfeed-(version).tar.gz` from the [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list project download page].

== Running ==

Run the feed validator as
{{{
feedvalidator.py <feed filename>
}}}

The warning "Timezone not checked (install pytz package for timezone validation)" is normal. feedvalidator can not check the spelling of the agency_timezone until you install the pytz package.


== Extra help for Windows XP/2000 users ==

Open a new Command Prompt window. Change into the directory containing feedvalidator.py (Hint: type "cd " without quotes and drag the icon of the folder into command prompt window). Run feedvalidator.py <feed filename>. If you don't want to type the feed filename try dragging it into the command prompt window.

= Command line options =

<pre>
Usage: feedvalidator.py `[`options] `[`<input GTFS.zip>]

Validates GTFS file (or directory) <input GTFS.zip> and writes a HTML
report of the results to validation-results.html.

If <input GTFS.zip> is ommited the filename is read from the console. Dragging
a file into the console may enter the filename.

#summary A Distribution of python tools

= Introduction =

The TransitFeedDistribution contains several parts, each with its own instructions

  * TransitFeed - a Python package for reading, writing, and validating feeds
  * FeedValidator - a command line tool that checks a Google Transit Feed for problems
  * ScheduleViewer - an application for exploring a feed on a map   
  * [KMLWriter] - an application for plotting a feed's stops in a KML file for viewing in Google Earth
  * [Merge] - combines two GTFS files into one
  * [GoogleRandomQueries] - an example program. generates random queries for Google Maps trip planner.
  * [UnusualTripFilter] - sets the trip_type depending on how often a pattern is used

= Download =

You may download the transitfeed distribution as Windows executables, a source tar ball or directly from our Subversion repository.

== Windows Executable ==

If you just want to run the tools you may download prebuilt Windows programs from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list the downloads section]. Download the latest version of `transitfeed-<version>-windows.zip` and unzip the contents into an empty directory.  Then see the ScheduleViewer and FeedValidator pages for further instructions.

== Install source distribution ==

Some features of the distribution depend on !ElementTree (added to Python's standard library in version 2.5) and pytz. You may need to install these manually.

`easy_install transitfeed` will download and install transitfeed and the scripts that come with it.

If you don't have easy_install on your computer you may download `transitfeed-<version>.tar.gz` from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list the downloads section]. Expand with `tar -xzf transitfeed-<version>.tar.gz`. You may run the tools directly from the expanded directory or run `python2.4 setup.py install`.

== Subversion repository ==

If you want to make changes grab our source from http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python.

===== 1.2.6 (2010-08-05) =====
  * New features
    * Introduction of an extensibility mechanism so validation can be altered without directly changing the base transitfeed code (r1296. Other related commits: r1319)
  * Validation changes
    * Transfers are now ID'd by the pair (from_stop_id, to_stop_id). While not prohibited by GTFS duplicate IDs are still allowed, but a warning is issued (r1268)
    * Warning when two trips in the same block have overlapping stop time intervals, and when both trips run on the same date. (Change by Brian Ferris - issue 230, r1297)
    * Removed error when transfers = 0 and transfer_duration > 0, as it is allowed by GTFS (issue 232, r1298)
    * Added a warning when there are no exceptions defined in calendar_dates.txt (r1306)
    * Added detection of large transfers. Issues a warning if the stops are >2km appart, and an error if they are >10km appart. Also issues a warning if min_transfer_time + 120s is not enough to cover the distance when walking at 2m/s (very fast walking). (issue 234, r1307)
    * util.!FloatStringToFloat and util.!NonNegIntStringToInt are now more flexible, issuing a warning when the number formats are not recognized but can be parsed by Python. As this is implementation dependent, it should be moved to an error as soon as possible. (r1350)
  * transitfeed API changes
    * Introduction of an object factory (r1281)
    * Introduction of the !HeadwayPeriod (later renamed to Frequency) and !GtfsFactory classes (r1281)
    * {{{Trip._FIELD_NAMES_HEADWAY}}} was removed. {{{Frequency._FIELD_NAMES}}} should be used instead. (r1296)
    * Invalid values in routes.txt's route_color and route_text_color are now replaced by the respective default values (r1281)
    * Schedule.!AddAgencyObject() no longer calls Validate() by default on the Agency object being added (r1281)
    * Schedule.!AddTripObject() no longer calls Validate() by default on the Trip object being added (r1281)
    * Schedule.!AddRouteObject() no longer calls Validate() on the Route object being added (r1281)
    * Instanciation of GTFS classes should not be done directly, but through !GtfsFactory instead (r1281)
    * Introduction of a !ShapePoint class (r1289)
    * Separation between problem reporting (what warnings and errors exist) and accumulation (how to handle them). (r1319)
    * Renamed a couple of classes to more closely mirror their respective GTFS names. Fare was renamed !FareAttribute and !HeadwayPeriod was renamed Frequency. GenericGTFSObject was also renamed to !GtfsObjectBase. (r1324)
  * Other changes
    * !FeedValidator on Windows now deletes database file successfully (issue 206, r1257)
    * Introduction of a GenericGTFSObject (later renamed !GtfsObjectBase) from which all GTFS classes should inherit (r1258)
    * Moved each GTFS class to its own file and removed the big {{{transitfeed/_transitfeed.py}}}. The API was not changed. (issue 196, r1275)
    * Fixed google_random_queries.py usage info, added URL to usage of several tools (r1280)
    * Added single date selection to Schedule Viewer (issue 17, r1300)
    * Unit tests now pass in Python 2.6 (issue 237, r1323)
    * All classes, except !StopTime for performance reasons, go through the !GtfsFactory instead of directly instantiating classes. (r1321)

===== 1.2.5 (2009-12-15) =====
  * Fixing the Windows binary distribution, which by mistake did not include the pytz package for timezone validation.

===== 1.2.4 (2009-12-11) =====
  * Moved {{{transitfeed.py}}} to {{{transitfeed/_transitfeed.py}}} to package it properly with {{{transitfeed/util.py}}} and {{{transitfeed/shapelib.py}}}; provided {{{transitfeed/__init__.py}}} to make the contents of transitfeed available under the same names as before.
  * Validation changes
    * Warn when there are several consecutive days without service in the feed validation (issue 188)
    * Warn when the successive stop-times have the same value of shape_dist_traveled and Error when they are decreasing (issue 125, issue 203)
    * The W3C formula for luminance comparison of line colors is used (partial fix for issue 108)
    * Warn when an input file has more than one column with the same name (issue 87)
    * Warn when start date or end date are set, but are not valid dates (issue 41)
    * For problem types that can be sorted by severity keep the N most severe instead of the first N found. These include !StopTooFarFromParentStation, !StopsTooClose, !StationsTooClose, !DifferentStationTooClose, !StopTooFarFromShapeWithDistTraveled, and !TooFastTravel. (issue 184)
  * transitfeed API changes
    * Schedule.Validate() is now not run by Loader.Load() by default. To call it implicitly set extra_validation to True, or call it explicitly indicating the service_gap_interval.
    * For performance reasons !ServicePeriod.!IsActiveOn now takes both a date string and, optionally, a date object representing the same date as the string.
  * Other changes
    * All tools now have a crash handler. The crash dump file is now called transitfeedcrash.txt
    * --help available in all tools
    * Make bottom panel in schedule viewer fixed height to partially address issue 45
    * Changes to make all tests pass in python 2.4

===== 1.2.3 (2009-11-05) =====
  * Validation changes
    * Warn about duplicate calendar_dates.txt records (issue 82, Jiri)
    * Ignore warning about travel in 0 seconds for times rounded to nearest minute (issue 193)
  * transitfeed API changes
    * Make `transitfeed.Route.AddTripObject` private
    * Only write agency.txt, stops.txt, routes.txt and trips.txt if they are created
  * Other changes
    * Fix google_random_queries.py to output URLs with ISO 8601 date formats to avoid locale issues (Richard)
    * Fix broken tests in Windows
    * Fix kmlparser

===== 1.2.2 (2009-10-16) =====

  * Validation changes
    * Warn if a stop is served by a route_type 1 and 3 (Subway and Bus). (Guangfan)
    * Warn if vehicles travel too fast between stops (Clancy)
    * Output warning or error if a stop is more than 100m or 1km from its parent (Fabien)
    * Warn if a schedule starts in the future, issue 159
    * Warn when a new version of transitfeed has been created (Guangfan)
    * Include summary of trips per day in validation-results.html
    * parent_station of stop X is not station Y but they are near changed from error to warning (issue 167)
    * Support HHH:MM:SS for really long distance trips
  * New features
    * `feedvalidator.py --duplicate_trip_check` Check for duplicate trips which go through the same stops with same service and start times. (Guangfan)
    * `feedvalidator.py --limit_per_type=N` default is 5. only show the first N warnings or errors of each type. This saves memory when there are many problems. (issue 37)
    * `unusual_trip_filter.py --route_type` apply filter only to selected route type. (Jiri)
    * `feedvalidator.py -o CONSOLE` print all errors and warnings to the command console. This lets the validator output useful information before a crash and saves memory when there are many problems.
    * `location_editor.py` adds support for editing station locations to schedule_viewer (Jiri)
  * Fix for
    * issue 57, sort of fixed. Added Schedule(load_stop_times=False) used by google_random_queries.py
    * issue 160, feedvalidator crash when given bad path
    * issue 153, merger crash when given wrong number of arguments
    * issue 156, merge raises error and crashes on input with warning or error
    * issue 177, Inconsistent line ends error message should say what file had the bad lines
    * `examples/google_random_queries.py` prints errors and warnings to console instead of crashing
  * transitfeed.Schedule gets new method !GetServicePeriodsActiveEachDate
  * The check for stops served by subway and bus and duplicate_trip_check use a second scan of stop_times, which increases validation time by ~10%. They may be disabled by default in a future release.

===== 1.2.1 (2009-05-26) =====

  * Validation changes
    * Change unknown 'route_type' value in 'route.txt' from error into warning. (Jiri)
    * Change unknown 'location_type' value in 'stops.txt'from error into warning. (Leio)
    * Warn if shape_dist_traveled is larger than max shape_dist_traveled of its shape (Leio)
    * issue 114, issue an Error if a trip has frequencies defined, but no stop_times. (Clancy)
    * check that for a stop entrance with location_type=2, its parent_station must have location_type=1. (Leio)
    * Stricter checking for route_long_name containing route_short_name. (Leio)
    * Some checking that shape and stop location are within 1000m when using shape_dist_traveled (Leio)
  * [Merge Merger] change
    * Use a temporary file instead of memory for stops_times. This allows feeds to be merged with less RAM but is slower. If you have small files or lots of RAM the option --memory_db reverts to the previous in-memory storage.
